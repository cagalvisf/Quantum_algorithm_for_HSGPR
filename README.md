# Quantum algorithm for Hilbert space Gaussian Process Regression

Gaussian processes inherently capture noise, smoothness parameters, and training data uncertainty. It is a widely used model for regression problems in supervised learning.  Its computational complexity quickly becomes intractable as the size of the data set grows. We propose a quantum algorithm specifically for low-rank Gaussian process regression to overcome this limitation, offering a promising alternative to traditional machine learning methods. Quantum principal component analysis is used to efficiently process the data, while conditional rotations facilitate the manipulation of quantum states. The Hadamard and Swap tests are then employed to evaluate the mean and variance of the posterior Gaussian distribution. We provide a quantum framework to implement Hilbert space Gaussian process regression in quantum computers. Our method provides polynomial computational complexity reduction over the classical method.
